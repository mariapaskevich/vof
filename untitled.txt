Part 1. the research

Part 2. the package

The package needs to be refactored: 

- Add logic for feature extraction 
        - lags and automated picking of relevant lags
- Forecast:
        #this one works to some extend, but doesnt provide evaluation in the package
        - add evaluation methods
- Optimization: 
        #currently almost doesn't exist. we need to have some kind of a baseline optimizer
        - add implementations for PILP and Nevergrad
        - add evaluation methods
